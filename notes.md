## AWS Stuff

### Server

- Hosted through Amazon

### Domain
- Linked to existing server with IP address

I ran into a problem earlier when I linked my Domain to my server with its IP address, but I then assigned an elastic IP address to my server. That changed the overall IP address without me knowing. It was a simple fix once I realized that it was connected to the wrong address, but it was an annoying head scratcher.

### Deploying Files

You have to run the `deployFiles.sh` from the directory that contains the files you are deploying every time you want to update the code on the website itself that isn't part of the `live` option in VsCode.

### Responsive Design

- Aside
    `float: right;` - makes it stick to the right side and everything else wraps around it.

- Display
    `None` doesn't render, `block` takes up the entire width, `inline` only takes enough width to render, `flex` allows for different sized columns like a controls tab on the left, `grid` renders into multiple responsive areas.

- Fractional Unit (fr)
    Automatically splits it up into equal divisions

- Grid - `display: grid;`  
    `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr)) - "fit as many onto the row as you can, minimum size of 300px"`  
- Flex - `display: flex;`  
    `flex-direction: column/row;` - defined in the parent object  
    `flex: 0 80px;` - "don't resize me, always make it 80px"  
    `flex: 1;` - resize it to a fractional unit  
- Media Queries  
```
    @media (orientation: portrait) {
        body {
            flex-direction: column;
        }
    }
```  
    if in portrait mode, make the body render in columns 

## JS

Java Script Arrays have a lot of functions. Here is a [link](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/array/array.md) to the class github explaining them.  
Below is an example of how to impletment an "arrow function":  
```
function testAll(input, tester) {
  return input.every(tester);
}

const fa = ["a","aaa","aaaa"]; /* returns false */
const ta = ["aaaa","aaaaaa"]; /* returns true */

console.log(testAll(fa, (i) => i.length > 3));
console.log(testAll(ta, (i) => i.length > 3));
```

## Arrow Functions

arrow functions replace regular function definitions to reduce size and increase readability. They also change the funtion of `this`, but that is an area to explore another day

Examples of converted functions:
```
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

let add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

// add(1,3) would both output 4
```

This is especially useful for functions that require a funciton as an input, like `.sort()` and `.forEach()`. Let's look at `.forEach()` first.

### .forEach()

Without an arrow function, you have to define the function first, then pass it in:
```
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

function increment(num) {
    return ++num;
}

numbers.forEach(increment);
```
You can also use an "anonymous function" to do it in one step, but it's visually clunky and hard to read:
```
numbers.forEach(function(num) {
    return ++num;
});
```

With an arrow function, you can do it all in one step and in one line, and it's very easy to see how it works:
```
numbers.forEach(num => ++num);
```

### .sort() 

`.sort()` works by converting each element in an array to a string, then sorting alphabetically. That doesn't work well for an array of numbers, as it would sort "108" as being "smaller" than "5" since it starts with "1". This is easily fixed with an arrow function:

```
const numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3];

numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);

// Output: [8, 5, 3, 2, 1]
```
Note that when the function passed into the `.sort()` method returns a negative value, it doesn't swap the values, and when it returns a postive value, it does swap them. To sort in ascending order the arrow function would be `(a,b) => a - b`.

Compare to using an anonymous function:
```
numbers.sort(function(a, b) {
    return b - a;
});
```

## Promises

Promises allow for the asynchronus execution of code. If a process takes a long time, like downloading an image, and you don't want to slow down the entire program, you can use a promise to initiate the download, do other things with your program while the download runs in the background, then check back in later to see if the download was successful or not.

Let's break it down using pseudocode:
```
let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    *download image*            // time consuming process
    if (*download complete*) {
        resolve("success");
    } else {
        reject("failure")
    }
});
```
Let's look now at how to do the "check back in later." This code is written when you want to initiate the download, and when the download is complete it immediately jumps back to it to execute what is in either the `.then()` block (Promise resolved), or the `.catch()` block (Promise rejected).

```
p.then((message) => {
    // executed if successfull
    console.log('image download was a ' + message)
}).catch((message) => {
    // executed if unsuccessful
    console.log('image download was a ' + message)
})
```

## Async and Await

`async'/'await` is a cleaner way of dealing with promises, making nested or chained promises much easier to deal with. Let's take a look at a simple example involving a program that makes requests to Google. Two functions return a promise, one checking if a request is allowed and the second processing that request:

```
function makeRequest(location) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =â€º { 
        console.log('Making Request to ${location}')
        if (location === 'Google') {
            resolve('Google says hi')
        } else {
            reject('We can only talk to Google')
        }
    }
)}

function processRequest(response) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        console.log('Processing response')
        resolve('Response info: ${response}')
    }
)}
```
Note that the second function will never reject; this is just for demonstration purposes. Now let's look at how we can handle these two functions with `async` and `await` using an asynchronus function:

```
async function doWork() {
    try {
        const response = await makeRequest('Google') // long process
        console.log('Response recieved')
        const processedResponse = await processRequest(response) // long process
        console.log(processedResponse)
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
}
```
The function definition is preceeded by `async`. This allows the function to run asynchronously with the rest of the code. 
Each time the code encounters a promise that takes an extended amount of time, it uses the `await` keyword to allow the code to go do something else while it waits. 
As soon as it executes, it finishes the next block of code until it hits the second `await` section, where it then repeats the same process. 
The whole thing is surrounded with a `try/except` block so it can catch any rejected Promises, like if we attempted to make a request to Facebook instead of Google.
